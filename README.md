# MIT6.S081-2021FALL
labs for MIT6.S081-2021FALL with out-of-box env

This repo is mainly for the environment. 

It is useful when you don't want to bother to build the lab tools step by step and find yourself get stuck before the real challenge even starts.

Fork this repo, and add "gitpod.io#" before your forked repo's url.
Now you can jump into the lab content and finsh those puzzles!

FYI: My lab answer exists as a submodule, and you should change the link.
DO NOT PEEK!!
